### Applications for mothers from multicultural families
Recently, the number of married immigrants has increased, so the childbirth in their family is also increasing. However, most of them are experiencing problems such as maladjustment in the new society, lack of preparation for pregnancy, and discomfort due to language and cultural differences. To solve this problem, we have created a parenting preparation application called ‘Dodam’ for multicultural families.
